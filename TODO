Allow types where exprs are expected, for instance:
    - make(T)
    - var y T = T{...}
    - var x []T = []T{...}
    - etc.

Auto-insert semicolons (bling-only)
    Roadmap:
        - expect (or accept) semicolons after blocks, since they will be
          inserted there.

Use dollar-sign ('$') to select members of a package. For instance:

    var x pkg$Type = a
    var y = pkg$function(x)

    Dollar is used because cc interprets it has an ident, making it useful for
    name mangling, while blingc will interpret it as a selector op (such as '.'
    and '->').

    Roadmap:
        - Remove dollar sign from keywords ($package, $import, $var, $func).
        - Change the name of things that use those keywords.
        - Make '$' a token.
        - Prepend pkg$ to names of all package decls (excluding builtins and C
                primatives).

    Eventually it will be emitted as '.' in bling and '$' in C.

Declare pkg members into named scopes, to be selected (initially) by '$'
selector.

Consolidate different selector ops ('.', '->', '$') into just one ('.'). Enforce
it when parsing bling code.

Compile to assembly.
